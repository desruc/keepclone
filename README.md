## Why another Google Keep clone? 😫

The honest truth - I started playing around with React DnD for a work project and things got a little out of hand!

## Features ⚡️

- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- Custom webpack setup!
- Tests powered by testing-library and Jest
- Firebase authentication and database provider
- Material-UI

## Setting up development environment 🛠

- Create a firebase account/project
- Create an empty `.env` file, copy `.env.example` contents into it, and fill in your firebase details
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`
